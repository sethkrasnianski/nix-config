# Review Changes

Use this skill for substantive reviews of changesets. A changeset may be a GitHub pull request, a local branch, a commit range, staged or unstaged working tree changes, a set of files, or other work that could reasonably be reviewed before merge. The goal is to produce high-signal review feedback, pressure-test it before presenting it, and help the user decide whether and how to post it.

## Core Principles

- Treat review as a bug/risk finding exercise, not a summary exercise.
- Review everything that could be in a PR: code, tests, docs, config, CI/CD, infrastructure, migrations, schemas/contracts, dependencies, and generated artifacts when intentionally included.
- Prioritize correctness, security, data integrity, deployment/runtime breakage, CI/validation status, tests, documentation, commit atomicity, observability, and rollback risk.
- Minor nits are allowed, but clearly label them as non-blocking.
- Always do a second pass before presenting or posting findings.
- Ask clarifying questions whenever target, base, ticket criteria, scope, severity expectations, or posting intent is unclear.
- Never post GitHub comments, reviews, approvals, or requests for changes without explicit user approval.
- Never expose secrets. If a secret appears in a file or log, report that secret material was exposed without repeating the value.
- Use `gh` for GitHub operations when available.
- Prefer line comments for findings tied to exact changed diff lines.
- Use the main PR comment for cross-cutting findings, items outside the diff, review stance, and deduplicated summary.
- For GitHub PRs, review existing comments, reviews, and author responses before deciding what feedback to add.
- Do not approve a PR if unresolved blocker-level findings remain.

## User Interaction Tools

Use the available user-question tool whenever the workflow says to ask the user.

- In OpenCode, use `question`. Because some clients render the structured question UI unreliably, **always also mirror the same question, its options, and your recommended option as plain chat text** in the same turn — never rely on the structured UI alone to carry the question.
- In Claude Code, use `askuserquestion` or the equivalent available ask-user tool.
- If no structured question tool is available, ask directly in chat and wait for the answer before continuing.

Ask concise questions with recommended options when possible. Continue without asking only when the user already provided the needed information or the safe default is explicit in this skill.

## Review Modes

### Read-Only Review

Inspect the changeset and return findings, change summary, 4C evaluation, and draft review body in chat. Do not post.

Use when:

- The user asks for a review without asking to post it.
- The target is a local branch, commit range, working tree change, file set, or any target that is not a GitHub PR.
- The user asks to pressure-test findings.
- The user has not explicitly approved posting comments.

### Formal GitHub Review

Post inline comments and/or an overall GitHub PR review with one of:

- `COMMENT`
- `APPROVE`
- `REQUEST_CHANGES`

Use only when:

- The target is a GitHub PR.
- The user selects Formal Review.
- The user explicitly chooses or confirms the review disposition.

## Required Workflow

### 1. Determine Review Target

Determine what is being reviewed before gathering context. Most users will specify the target in the request; if they do not, ask.

Supported targets include:

- GitHub PR URL.
- PR number.
- `owner/repo#123`.
- Local branch name.
- Current local branch.
- Commit range.
- Staged changes.
- Unstaged working tree changes.
- Specific files or directories, when explicitly requested.

If the target is missing or ambiguous, ask the user to choose the review target.

Recommended target options:

- `Current Branch`: Review current branch against the repository default branch.
- `GitHub PR`: Review a PR URL, number, or `owner/repo#123`.
- `Local Branch`: Review a named local branch against the repository default branch unless another base is provided.
- `Working Tree`: Review staged and/or unstaged local changes.
- `Commit Range`: Review an explicit commit range.
- `Files Or Directories`: Review specific paths.

For local branch reviews, default to comparing against the repository default branch unless the user asks for a different base. Determine the default branch from GitHub metadata or local git refs when possible. If unable to determine it, ask the user for the base branch.

Recommended commands for default branch discovery:

```bash
gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name'
git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD --short
git remote show origin
```

Do not mutate the user's branch while determining the target. Do not checkout, rebase, reset, stash, or commit unless explicitly requested and approved.

### 2. Gather Ticket Or Acceptance Criteria

Before reviewing, determine whether the user provided ticket context, acceptance criteria, issue links, product requirements, or a PR description. If none was provided, ask whether they want to provide it.

Recommended options:

- `Provide Ticket`: User will provide ticket URL, issue text, or acceptance criteria.
- `No Ticket`: Review against code, tests, docs, and stated intent only.
- `Acceptance Criteria Only`: User will paste expected behavior without a ticket link.

Use ticket context to validate completeness and expected behavior. Do not block the review if no ticket exists. In this harness, a PR opened by the `auto` pipeline carries the plan (research + approach + step list) in the PR body itself — treat that body as the acceptance criteria when no separate ticket is given (see `worktree-workflow` skill).

### 3. Gather Changeset Context

Gather metadata, files, checks, comments, and diffs appropriate to the target type.

#### GitHub PR Target

Recommended commands:

```bash
gh pr view <pr> --json number,title,author,baseRefName,headRefName,headRefOid,body,commits,files,additions,deletions,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup,comments,reviews
gh pr diff <pr> --name-only
gh pr checks <pr>
gh pr diff <pr>
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number>/comments
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number>/comments
```

Also inspect relevant changed files directly where needed:

```bash
gh api -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.raw" \
  "repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/<path>?ref=<headRefName>"
```

#### Local Branch Target

Default to comparing the branch against the repository default branch unless the user specified another base.

Recommended commands:

```bash
git status --short
git branch --show-current
git diff --name-only <base>...<branch>
git diff <base>...<branch>
git log --oneline <base>..<branch>
```

Use `HEAD` for `<branch>` when reviewing the current branch.

#### Working Tree Target

Clarify whether to review staged changes, unstaged changes, or both when unclear.

Recommended commands:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --cached --name-only
git diff --cached
git diff --name-only
git diff
```

#### Commit Range Target

Use the exact range the user provides. If the range is ambiguous, ask.

Recommended commands:

```bash
git diff --name-only <range>
git diff <range>
git log --oneline <range>
```

#### File Or Directory Target

Read the requested files and inspect nearby context. If the user expects a diff-based review, ask for the base or range.

Use line-numbered reads when possible so findings have precise references.

### 4. Review Existing PR Feedback

For GitHub PR targets, inspect existing review comments, issue comments, review decisions, and author responses before doing the main review. Skip this step for non-PR targets unless an associated PR is discovered.

Use existing PR feedback to determine:

- Whether this is the first substantive review, a follow-up review, or a re-review after author changes.
- Which findings others already raised.
- Which existing threads or comments appear unresolved.
- Whether the author responded to or addressed prior feedback.
- Whether new commits likely addressed prior comments.
- Whether proposed findings would duplicate existing feedback.
- Whether prior blocker-level concerns still affect the current diff.

Recommended commands:

```bash
gh pr view <pr> --json comments,reviews,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup,commits,headRefOid
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number>/comments
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number>/comments
```

When richer thread state is needed, use the GitHub GraphQL API to inspect review threads and resolution state:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='<query for pullRequest reviewThreads { nodes { isResolved comments { nodes { author { login } body path line createdAt } } } } }>'
```

Avoid reposting the same issue unless the prior feedback is incomplete, incorrect, unresolved and needs escalation, or the current diff reintroduced the issue. If existing feedback already covers a concern, acknowledge it in the review context instead of duplicating it.

### 5. Understand Changeset Intent

Extract:

- What the changeset claims to do.
- What systems it touches.
- Whether it affects infrastructure, deployment, auth, persistence, billing, background jobs, data migrations, third-party APIs, permissions, docs, or secrets.
- Whether production is affected immediately or later.
- Which checks ran and what they actually validated.
- Current CI status, including failed, pending, skipped, missing, or irrelevant checks.
- Whether documentation, migration notes, runbooks, API docs, user docs, or setup instructions should change.
- Whether commits are atomic, reviewable, and organized as coherent vertical slices.
- For PRs, where the changeset sits in the review lifecycle and whether prior feedback has been addressed.

If intent is unclear, ask the user before judging completeness. If the changeset is large, focus first on files with runtime, deployment, security, data, or compatibility impact.

### 6. Fan Out Specialist Review

When agents or subagents are available, fan out focused review work after gathering context. If agents are not available, perform these passes manually.

Recommended specialist passes:

- `Security And Data Integrity`: Secrets, auth, permissions, injection, unsafe deserialization, data loss/corruption, migration safety, rollback risk.
- `Test Coverage`: Whether changed behavior is exercised by unit, integration, e2e, CI, migration, or infrastructure validation. In this harness, also confirm the TDD invariant held: a failing test existed before the implementation that made it pass (see `tdd-loop` skill) — treat a commit with new behavior but no corresponding new/updated test as a finding, not an assumption.
- `Repo Compatibility`: Whether the changes fit existing architecture, conventions, dependency versions, generated code workflows, public APIs, consumers, deployment paths, and runtime assumptions.
- `Ticket Validation`: Whether the changes satisfy ticket context and acceptance criteria, and whether anything requested is missing or contradicted.
- `Documentation`: Whether user-facing docs, API docs, setup docs, operational docs, migration notes, examples, changelogs, or runbooks need updates; whether existing docs became stale.
- `Commit Atomicity`: Whether commits are focused, independently reviewable, correctly ordered, and free of fixup/WIP/noise commits or unrelated changes.
- `Review Lifecycle`: For PRs, whether existing comments already cover candidate findings, whether author responses addressed prior feedback, whether unresolved threads remain relevant, and whether this is a first review or follow-up.

Each specialist pass should return:

- Confirmed findings.
- Weakened or speculative findings.
- Files or areas inspected.
- Relevant evidence.
- Confidence level.

Do not treat specialist output as final. Reconcile duplicates, pressure-test claims, and discard findings that do not survive scrutiny.

### 7. Build High-Level Change Summary

Build a concise bulleted summary of the main changes for the reviewer. Include non-code changes such as docs, config, CI/CD, infrastructure, dependency updates, migrations, generated artifacts, and tests when present.

Use this summary to confirm scope and catch mismatches between stated intent and actual changes. If the summary reveals ambiguity, ask the user for clarification.

### 8. Initial Review Pass

Identify candidate findings.

For each candidate finding, capture:

- Severity: critical, high, medium, low, nit.
- File and line if possible.
- The concrete failure mode.
- Why it matters.
- What would fix or mitigate it.
- Evidence from code, diff, logs, docs, CI, ticket criteria, or existing repo behavior.
- Whether it is introduced by this changeset or appears pre-existing.
- Whether existing PR feedback already covers it.

Prefer findings that answer:

- Can this break deploys?
- Can this break runtime behavior?
- Can this expose secrets or broaden permissions?
- Can this corrupt or lose data?
- Are required checks failing, pending, skipped, or missing?
- Are tests/CI missing for the changed behavior?
- Does rollback still work?
- Are generated resources/configs tied to the wrong environment?
- Are there concurrency, timeout, idempotency, pagination, retry, or cold-start issues?
- Are inputs validated and are injection risks avoided?
- Are docs required because setup, usage, API behavior, operations, or migration behavior changed?
- Does the implementation satisfy the ticket or acceptance criteria?
- Are commits atomic, coherent, and aligned with the repo's commit conventions?
- Has existing PR feedback already raised or resolved this concern?

Avoid:

- Style-only comments unless the user requested them.
- Speculative findings without a concrete failure path.
- Repeating the same issue in multiple places unless each instance matters.
- Posting or presenting pre-existing issues as if this changeset introduced them.
- Duplicating existing PR review feedback unless the duplicate is intentional and adds value.

### 9. Evaluate The 4Cs

Evaluate the changeset across the 4Cs. Keep this separate from severity-ranked findings so it provides review context without diluting blocker-level issues.

- `Correctness`: Does the changed behavior work as intended, including edge cases, errors, security, data integrity, and operational behavior?
- `Completeness`: Does it satisfy ticket criteria, stated intent, required tests, required docs, migrations, compatibility, and rollout needs?
- `Conciseness`: Is the change appropriately scoped, with atomic commits and without avoidable complexity, duplication, unrelated edits, or unnecessary dependencies?
- `Clarity`: Is the implementation understandable, with clear names, readable tests, useful docs, and maintainable structure?

Use clear ratings such as `strong`, `acceptable`, `needs work`, or `unclear`, with short evidence for each. If a 4C assessment depends on missing context, ask the user or label it `unclear`.

### 10. Pressure-Test Pass

Before showing findings to the user or posting them, re-check every candidate finding.

For each finding, classify it as:

- `confirmed blocker`: clear bug/security/deploy risk that should block.
- `confirmed non-blocking`: valid but not a blocker.
- `needs context`: plausible, but depends on external configuration or intent.
- `weakened`: partially valid but severity should be reduced.
- `drop`: does not survive scrutiny.

Pressure-test using:

- Actual workflow logs, if relevant and available.
- CI status, check results, and failing check logs.
- GitHub Actions reusable workflow semantics.
- Existing repo conventions.
- CI workflow path filters and job contents.
- Documentation for platform behavior, if needed.
- Current PR comments and author notes.
- Base branch behavior, to avoid flagging pre-existing issues as introduced.
- Ticket criteria and explicit user-provided requirements.
- Specialist agent findings and counter-evidence.
- Commit history, to distinguish patch-level issues from history hygiene issues.
- Existing PR comments, review threads, author replies, and later commits.

When a finding weakens, say so plainly. Do not keep weak findings as blockers.

### 11. Decide Comment Placement

Split final feedback into two buckets when the target is a GitHub PR. For non-PR targets, produce the same content as chat output instead of posting.

#### Inline Comments

Use inline comments when:

- The issue maps to a changed line in the PR diff.
- The comment can be understood locally.
- The comment asks for a concrete change or clarification.

Inline comment format:

```md
<concise issue statement>

<why it matters / concrete failure mode>

<suggested fix or question>
```

Keep inline comments focused. Do not include AI disclosure in every inline comment unless the user asks.

#### Reviewer Notes Versus Author-Facing Review

Keep internal reviewer analysis separate from PR feedback intended for the author.

Use reviewer notes for:

- Existing review context and PR lifecycle stage.
- CI/validation status and whether checks cover the changed behavior.
- High-level change summary.
- 4C evaluation.
- Ticket or acceptance criteria validation.
- Commit atomicity and history hygiene.
- Specialist pass notes.
- Weakened or dropped findings.
- Duplicates intentionally avoided because prior feedback already covers them.
- Recommended review mode and disposition.

Use the author-facing review body for concrete PR feedback:

- Confirmed blockers or non-blocking findings that need author action.
- Cross-cutting issues that do not map cleanly to a changed line.
- Missing CI/test/doc coverage when actionable.
- Deployment sequencing or rollback concerns when actionable.
- Direct questions that need author clarification.
- Final stance in author-facing language.

Do not dump reviewer notes into the PR comment. The author-facing review should read like practical PR feedback to the author, not an analysis report to the reviewer.

The author-facing review body should avoid repeating inline details, and should not include a section that summarizes or lists what the inline comments cover — that is redundant with the inline threads themselves. Limit the body to cross-cutting findings, direct questions, and the overall stance.

If AI disclosure is required or requested, place it as a short footer rather than opening the review with it:

```md
AI-assisted review using `<tool/agent name>` with `<model id>`.
```

Use the active tool/agent name and model ID from the current session if available.

### 12. Ask For Review Mode Before Posting

Before posting anything, ask the user to choose the review mode unless they already specified it.

Use the available user-question tool.

Recommended options:

- `Read-Only Review`: Print the review in chat only. Do not post.
- `Formal Review`: Post a GitHub PR review with inline comments and/or an overall review body.

If the target is not a GitHub PR, Formal Review is unavailable. Explain that read-only review can proceed, or ask whether the user wants to provide a PR target.

If the user selects Formal Review, ask for the disposition and include your recommendation in the question.

Recommended disposition options:

- `Comment`: Use when findings are non-blocking, informational, need author clarification, or CI is pending/inconclusive without confirmed blockers.
- `Approve`: Use only when no unresolved blocker-level or important correctness issues remain, including unresolved prior blocker feedback, and required CI is not failing or pending.
- `Request Changes`: Use when confirmed blocker-level findings remain, prior blocker feedback is still unresolved, or required CI is failing because of the changeset.

Also ask if unclear:

- Whether to include AI disclosure.
- Whether minor nits should be posted or omitted.
- Whether to post security-sensitive findings publicly or summarize privately.

Never post security-sensitive details publicly without explicit user confirmation. Summarize privately when a finding could expose an exploit path, secret, or sensitive operational detail.

### 13. Preview And Confirm Review

Before posting a formal GitHub review, generate a complete preview and ask the user to approve it with the available user-question tool (and its plain-text mirror, per "User Interaction Tools" above). Do not post anything until the user approves the exact preview.

The preview must include:

- Target PR and reviewed `headRefOid`.
- Formal disposition: `COMMENT`, `APPROVE`, or `REQUEST_CHANGES`.
- Author-facing review body exactly as it will be posted.
- Inline comments exactly as they will be posted, including path, line, side, and body.
- Findings intentionally kept out of GitHub.
- Sensitive findings that require private handling.
- Any line-mapping uncertainty or comments that could not be placed inline.

Recommended confirmation options:

- `Post As Shown`: Post the exact preview.
- `Revise Review`: Ask what should change, regenerate the full preview, and ask again.
- `Do Not Post`: Keep the review draft in chat only.

If the user approves only part of the preview, post only the approved subset. If the user requests changes to the review, do not post until a revised preview is generated and approved.

Before generating or posting the preview, re-fetch the current PR `headRefOid`. If the PR head changed since review, stop and ask whether to re-review before preparing the posting preview.

### 14. Posting Procedure

Only post after explicit approval.

Before posting:

- Get current `headRefOid`.
- Compare it to the previewed and approved `headRefOid`; if it changed, stop and ask whether to re-review before posting.
- Use the latest commit SHA for inline comments only after confirming the approved preview is still current.
- Prefer GitHub line comments on changed diff lines.
- If line mapping fails or changes after preview approval, stop, regenerate the preview, and ask for approval again.
- Post only the exact approved preview. Do not silently rewrite, omit, move, or add comments during posting.
- Never include secret values.

Recommended command:

```bash
gh pr view <pr> --json headRefOid --jq '.headRefOid'
```

Post inline comments with:

```bash
gh api -X POST "repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number>/comments" \
  -f commit_id="<headRefOid>" \
  -f path="<path>" \
  -F line=<line> \
  -f side="RIGHT" \
  -f body="<comment body>"
```

Submit formal reviews with `gh pr review` using the correct event only after the user explicitly chooses it.

Recommended commands:

```bash
gh pr review <number> -R <owner>/<repo> --comment --body "<body>"
gh pr review <number> -R <owner>/<repo> --approve --body "<body>"
gh pr review <number> -R <owner>/<repo> --request-changes --body "<body>"
```

### 15. After Posting

Report:

- What was posted.
- Links to posted comments or review.
- Anything that failed to post.
- Any findings intentionally kept as draft-only.
- Whether the PR head changed during review or posting.

## Severity Guidance

### Blocking / Request Changes Candidates

Use blocker-level language for:

- Runtime failures on normal paths.
- Deployment failures or broken promotion/cutover.
- Secret exposure or material permission expansion.
- Data corruption/loss risks.
- Missing validation for user-controlled input that can create injection/security issues.
- Missing CI for newly added critical infra code.
- Tests passing while not exercising the changed behavior.
- Required docs or migration instructions missing when omission can cause failed deploys, broken setup, unsafe operations, or incorrect user behavior.

### Non-Blocking Candidates

Use non-blocking language for:

- Maintainability concerns without immediate failure.
- Hard-coded values in staging-only paths when production is unaffected.
- Cleanup/reporting drift that does not break execution.
- Documentation gaps that do not change behavior or operational safety.
- Naming or style issues.

## Security And Secret Handling

Always proactively look for:

- Secrets committed to files.
- Secrets printed in CI logs.
- Generated secrets not masked with `::add-mask::`.
- Over-broad IAM, OIDC, GitHub token, cloud, or deploy permissions.
- Public endpoints relying only on weak/shared keys.
- Missing auth, missing CORS restrictions, or unintended anonymous access.
- Shell injection through unquoted PR/user-controlled values.
- Unsafe deserialization or command execution.
- Missing validation for user-controlled input.

If secret material is discovered:

- Do not repeat it.
- State that secret material was exposed.
- Recommend rotation if the value may be live.
- Recommend masking and safer handling.
- Ask before posting any public comment that could reveal sensitive detail.

## Documentation Review Checklist

When behavior, setup, operations, APIs, migrations, or configuration change, inspect:

- README and setup instructions.
- API docs and generated contract docs.
- User-facing docs, examples, and screenshots.
- Operational runbooks and deployment notes.
- Migration guides, rollback notes, and data backfill instructions.
- Environment variable documentation and `.env.example` placeholder names.
- Changelog or release notes when the repo uses them.
- Comments or docs that become stale because of the changeset.

Documentation findings should explain who would be misled or blocked by the missing/stale docs.

## Commit Atomicity Review Checklist

When the target has commit history, inspect whether commits follow atomic commit principles.

Look for:

- Each commit represents one coherent, reviewable change.
- Refactors, mechanical changes, and feature behavior are separated when practical.
- Tests and docs are included in the same vertical slice as the behavior they validate or describe.
- Commit order tells a logical implementation story.
- No `wip`, `fixup`, `oops`, revert-noise, or follow-up commits should be cleaned up before review.
- No unrelated files or opportunistic edits are mixed into a commit.
- Commit messages follow repository conventions — Conventional Commits by default in this harness (see `atomic-commits` skill), or the repo's own established convention if it differs.
- Each commit can reasonably pass validation on its own when the repository expects that standard.

Recommended commands:

```bash
git log --oneline <base>..<branch>
git diff-tree --stat --oneline <commit>
git show --stat --oneline --name-status <commit>
```

Treat commit atomicity findings as review hygiene unless the history creates practical risk, such as making rollback, bisect, release notes, or review materially harder. If the final diff is correct but the history should be cleaned up, recommend reslicing instead of blocking on code behavior.

## Review Lifecycle Checklist

When reviewing a GitHub PR, inspect existing feedback so the review fits the PR's current lifecycle.

Look for:

- Whether this is the first substantive review, a follow-up review, or a re-review after author changes.
- Existing review comments that already cover candidate findings.
- Unresolved review threads or comments that still apply to the current diff.
- Author comments that explain intent, reject prior feedback, or claim an issue was fixed.
- New commits after prior reviews that may have addressed earlier comments.
- Prior approvals, requests for changes, or review decisions that should affect the recommended disposition.
- Feedback that should not be duplicated because it is already clear and visible.
- Feedback that should be escalated because it remains unresolved after prior discussion.

Use lifecycle context to calibrate tone and disposition. A first review can introduce issues directly; a follow-up review should focus on what changed, what remains unresolved, and whether earlier feedback was addressed.

## CI And Validation Checklist

For GitHub PRs, inspect CI status before recommending a disposition.

Look for:

- Required checks that are failing, pending, skipped, cancelled, or missing.
- Non-required checks that reveal real risk.
- Checks that are green but do not exercise the changed behavior.
- Path filters or workflow conditions that skipped validation unexpectedly.
- Failing logs that confirm or contradict candidate findings.
- Whether docs, infra, migrations, generated code, or dependency changes received appropriate validation.

For local branches or working tree reviews, identify the smallest relevant validation from repo docs, package scripts, build files, CI config, or existing conventions. Do not run expensive or destructive validation unless the user asked for it or explicitly approves.

Use CI context carefully. Failing required CI should usually prevent an approval recommendation, but passing CI does not prove correctness if the changed behavior is not covered.

## GitHub Actions Review Checklist

When workflows change, inspect:

- Trigger events and branch filters.
- `pull_request` vs `pull_request_target` risks.
- `permissions`.
- Environment usage and environment secrets.
- Reusable workflow secret passing semantics.
- Path filters and whether changed files actually trigger relevant CI.
- Concurrency groups.
- Whether generated secrets or heredocs appear in logs.
- Whether deployment jobs run on PRs, pushes, or only after merge.
- Whether outputs are wired correctly.
- Whether hard-coded ARNs, URLs, accounts, regions, or role names are intentional.

## Infrastructure Review Checklist

When IaC or deployment changes, inspect:

- Least privilege.
- Resource naming and environment isolation.
- Staging/prod separation.
- Secrets source and runtime loading.
- Rollback path.
- State/backing service migration.
- Generated outputs and how consumers receive them.
- Timeouts, memory, concurrency, cold starts, idempotency, retries.
- Build context and ignored files.
- CI validation: format, lint, typecheck, unit tests, synth/plan.
- Whether production is affected now or only in a follow-up.

### Author-Facing Formal Review Body

Write a PR-specific review body for the author. Avoid canned greetings, internal scoring, reviewer-only analysis, and exhaustive summaries. Make the feedback concrete, actionable, and proportional to the selected disposition.

Use this shape for request-changes reviews:

```md
Requesting changes because <specific blocker>. <Describe the concrete failure mode and impact in one or two sentences>.

Additional notes:

- <cross-cutting actionable issue, if any>
- <missing validation/docs/deployment concern, if any>

Overall: <what needs to change before this is ready>.

AI-assisted review using `<tool/agent name>` with `<model id>`.
```

Use this shape for comment reviews:

```md
I left a few comments/questions worth considering. Nothing from this pass looks blocking, but <area> may need confirmation or follow-up.

Additional notes:

- <non-blocking follow-up or question, if any>

Overall: <short PR-specific stance>.

AI-assisted review using `<tool/agent name>` with `<model id>`.
```

Use this shape for approvals:

```md
This looks good to me. <Mention any important non-blocking context, if relevant>.

Non-blocking follow-ups:

- <follow-up, if any>

Overall: <short approval rationale tied to the PR>.

AI-assisted review using `<tool/agent name>` with `<model id>`.
```

Omit empty sections. Omit the AI-assisted footer when the user asks not to include it or the workflow does not require it.
